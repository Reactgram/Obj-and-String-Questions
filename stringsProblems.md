### Basic Concepts:

1. String Reversal
Problem: Write a program  that reverses a given string.
Example: Input: "hello" -> Output: "olleh"

2. Sum of Digits
Problem: Create a program  that takes a number as a string and returns the sum of its digits.
Example: Input: "123" -> Output: 6 (1 + 2 + 3)

### Immutable Strings:

3. Character Replacement
Problem: Implement a program  that replaces all occurrences of 'Q' with 'P' in a given string.
Example: Input: "QUALQITQY" -> Output: "PUALPITPY"

### Case Checking:

4. String Case Analyzer
Problem: Develop a program  that determines if a given string consists entirely of uppercase letters, lowercase letters.
Example: Input: "HELLO" -> Output: "Uppercase"
Input: "helloworld" -> Output: "Lowercase"

### Substrings:

5. Three-Letter Substrings
Problem: Write a program that prints all possible three-letter substrings of a given string.
Example: Input: "abcd" -> Output:  "abc", "bcd"

6.

1. Asterisk Pattern
Problem: Create a program  that prints an asterisk pattern where each line has one more asterisk than the previous line, up to n lines.
Example: Input: n = 3
Output:
 *
 * *
 * * *
 * * * *
 * * * * *

### String Methods:

7. Remove Duplicates
Problem: Implement a program  that removes all duplicate characters from a string while maintaining the original order.
Example: Input: "programming" -> Output: "progamin"

8:

1. Password Strength Checker
Problem: Design a program  that checks if a given password is strong based on the following criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()-+)
Example: Input: "P@ssw0rd" -> Output: "Strong password"
Input: "weakpass" -> Output: "Weak password"

### Miscellaneous:

9. Word Splitter
Problem: Write a program  that splits a sentence into words
Example: Input: "Hello, world! How are you?" -> Output: "Hello", "world", "How", "are", "you"

10. Word Reversal
Problem: Create a program  that takes a sentence and returns it with each word reversed while maintaining the original word order.
Example: Input: "Hello world" -> Output: "olleH dlrow"
